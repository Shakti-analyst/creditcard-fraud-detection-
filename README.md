# Capstone Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Shakti Pratap Singh**

This capstone project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset from European cardholders recorded in September 2013. The project addresses the challenge of significant class imbalance and utilizes various techniques to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection.

**Key Steps:**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to uncover patterns and feature distributions.
Data Preprocessing: Standardized and cleaned the data to ensure quality inputs for modeling.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Implemented resampling techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and under-sampling to address class imbalance.
Modeling: Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned model parameters using grid search and cross-validation to optimize performance.
Deployment: Serialized the best-performing model (XGBoost) for deployment in a production environment.
Results: Achieved high performance metrics, particularly in precision and recall, which are critical for accurate fraud detection.
